I am a 16-year-old full-stack web developer from Bakhchisaray with experience in both front-end and back-end development. I create responsive and user-friendly interfaces as well as secure and scalable server-side applications, working with modern frameworks and best coding practices. Over the years, I have dedicated my time to learning, building, and refining projects that solve real-world problems. I am already close to a mid-level skill set and continue to improve by exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and deepening my understanding of clean code and efficient architecture. For me, programming is not just a technical skill but a way to bring ideas to life and make a meaningful impact.
